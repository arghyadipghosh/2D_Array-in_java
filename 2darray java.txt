syntax:
datatype array_name[][]=new datatype[row_size][column_size];
e.g:
int arr2d[][]=new int[4][5];  ->> it will create a 2d array having 4 rows and 5 columns


by default after declaratuion of an integer array whether 1d or 2d it gets initialized with 0

int arr2d[0][2]=15;
System.out.println(arr[0][2]);
-> this will print 15 as output

int arr2d[][]={{1,2,3},{4,5,6}};
-> this is another way to initilise a 2d array
System.out.pritnln(arr2d); -> this will print [[I@45673d30 
                               it means "[["->signifies that it is 2d array, "I" indicates that it is integer type and after "@" whatever it prints is thr referenve
                               address of the 2d array
